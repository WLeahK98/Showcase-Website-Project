            <p>Hi! I'm Wehlia, nice to meet you!
                <br> I'm a huge anime fan, <em>specifically Naruto</em>. 
                <br>Proud recent cat parent and now happy to add aspiring software developer to this growing list of randomly awesome titles (if I do say so myself). 
                <br>Last year, I completed a Level 3 Software Developer course with Westmnster Adult Education Service 
                    and Code Institute. I thouroughly enjoyed it, and one of the most memerobale experiences was when I 
                    had the chance to take part in my first hackathon. The hackathon theme was Star Wars, and our team 
                    decided on the idea of a Star Wars inspired dating app called Wookie Woo.
                <br>
                At the time I wasn't that confident in my coding abilities; however, I did have some experience in creating videos using editing softwares and my team (The Coding Rsisistence) was nice enough to let me make an introduction video for our website.

<h2 class ="titles">The journey so far...</h2>
<p>Currently I volunteer as a library assistant, assisting with arts and crafts activities for children at my local library. In my spare time, I take part in other volunteering activites like marshalling at Battersea Park run, occasionally volunteering as a photographer for them, spend time with my family and cat and take part in activities in my local library such as knitting club. In addition to this, I scoure the internet looking for cool (but also ideally easy) HTML, CSS and JavaScript YouTube tutorials so I can learn how to make awesome websites, which have been a great help in further developing my coding/web design abilities and a great help in the building of my very first website!

            <h3>Reasons as to why I’d like to move into a career as a web developer, include but are not limited to the following, in no order of importance:</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>I’ve always been fascinated about learning how to code, I honestly thought it was quite cool. I had previously tried making a basic website using Notepad and the help of some YouTube tutorials and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was the combination of creativity and technology, the fact that by writing lines of code you can not only impact the look of a webpage, you can add effects and images. The fact that there a myriad of different coding languages  to use and choose from. The aspect of problem solving and finding innovative solutions. All of these intriguing aspects and more, all helped to solidify my decision in why I’d like to move into a career as a software developer.</li>
                    <li>I have always been interested in the Tech industry and even studied some IT related courses , however I unfortunately didn’t continue studying in that field until recently. Back in 2015, I was lucky enough to study a Level 1 IT users skills course which I enjoyed greatly. It wasn’t until recently however that I rediscovered my innate passion for IT when I enrolled on a Level 2 NCFE coding course. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and these past few years I have been re-discovering my passion for IT and trying my best to teach myself coding with the help of numerous YouTube tutorials and a myriad of free online coding course websites./li>
                    <li>I have noticed that the IT industry is in constant perpetual state of growth. It is an industry that is always changing and new technology is always being invented and as someone who loves learning, creativity and actively seeks out challenges to develop new skills  that means there is never a dull moment and many opporunities for growth.</li>
                    <li>The IT industry offers multiple career paths and opportunities in every sector which is something I find amazing.</li>
                    <li>I am also quite a social person and would love to get to know and meet new people, work on exciting projects along side like minded individuals who have a passion for IT as I do. </li>
                    <li>And last but not least, I find it fun! </li>
