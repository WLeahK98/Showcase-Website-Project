            <p>Hi! I'm Wehlia, nice to meet you!
                <br> I'm a huge anime fan, <em>specifically Naruto</em>. 
                <br>Proud recent cat parent and now happy to add aspiring software developer to this growing list of randomly awesome titles (if I do say so myself). 
                <br>Last year, I completed a Level 3 Software Developer course with Westmnster Adult Education Service 
                    and Code Institute. I thouroughly enjoyed it, and one of the most memerobale experiences was when I 
                    had the chance to take part in my first hackathon. The hackathon theme was Star Wars, and our team 
                    decided on the idea of a Star Wars inspired dating app called Wookie Woo.
                <br>
                At the time I wasn't that confident in my coding abilities; however, I did have some experience in creating videos using editing softwares and my team (The Coding Rsisistence) was nice enough to let me make an introduction video for our website.

<div class="wrapper2">
    <p>Currently I volunteer as a library assistant, assisting with arts and crafts activities for children at my local library. In my spare time, I take part in other volunteering activites like marshalling at Battersea Park run, occasionally volunteering as a photographer for them, spend time with my family and cat and take part in activities in my local library such as knitting club. In addition to this, I scoure the internet looking for cool (but also ideally easy) HTML, CSS and JavaScript YouTube tutorials so I can learn how to make awesome websites, which have been a great help in further developing my coding/web design abilities and a great help in the building of my very first website!

                            <p>I’ve always been fascinated by learning to code. I honestly thought it was pretty cool. I had previously tried building a basic website using Notepad, with the help of some YouTube tutorials, and thoroughly enjoyed it. 
                                The combination of creativity and technology—the fact that by writing lines of code you can not only influence the appearance of a webpage but also add effects and images—fascinates me. </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>The fact that there are a myriad of different coding languages to choose from and learn also intrigues me. I also like the fact that theres always something new to discover in a field that is constantly evolving.
As someone who is committed to continuous proffesional development, web development offers both challenging problems and the opportunity to implement innovative solutions,to learn, grow and excel in an exciting field.As well as the opportunity to use a wide range of technologies and learn how to write professional, high-quality code.All of these intriguing aspects, and more, helped solidify my decision to pursue a career as a software developer.</p>

                            <p>I have noticed that the IT industry, including software, is in a constant perpetual state of growth and moving fast. It is an industry that is always changing and new technology is always being invented, and as someone who loves learning, creativity and actively seeks out challenges to develop new skills, that means there is never a dull moment and many opportunities for growth.</p>
